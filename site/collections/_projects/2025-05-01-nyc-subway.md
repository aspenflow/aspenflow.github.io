What are some factors that influence subway ridership? I built ETL pipelines processing 100M+ subway ridership records 
from NYC's API and climate data, reducing runtime by 45% with workflow and rate limit optimizations. Then, I conducted 
statistical analysis using mixed-effects modeling, revealing insights on borough- and weather-specific ridership trends.

A pre-print paper discussing methods and findings [was published to Cornell arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02990).
